Location Matcher: A Data-Driven Solution for Optimal QSR Outlet Locations

Introduction:
Location Matcher is an innovative tool designed to empower Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) chains, exemplified by abCoffee, in making strategic decisions about new outlet locations. By harnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning algorithms, this project offers a systematic approach to identify optimal locations, enabling QSR chains to expand their businesses with confidence.

How it Works:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Utilizes web scraping techniques to gather real-time data on existing outlets from Google Maps and other relevant sources.
Two datasets, abCoffee_outlets and cafe_data_1, are processed to obtain location coordinates and types of outlets (Cafe, Coffee, Tea, Other).
Cluster Creation:
For each abCoffee outlet, creates a cluster within a 100-meter radius.
Identifies nearby operational outlets and assigns weights based on their types (Coffee: 10, Tea: 5, Cafe: 15, Other: 8).
Calculates the overall weight of the cluster, considering the distance and type-specific weights.
Data Analysis and Prediction:
Compares the clusters of abCoffee outlets with those of operational outlets in Mumbai.
Utilizes a custom prediction algorithm to identify similar clusters based on weights and outlet types.
Predicts the ideal location for a new outlet by analyzing the most similar cluster's characteristics.
User Interface:
Provides a user-friendly interface for QSR chains to input specific coordinates or area details.
Delivers valuable insights and recommendations, including success rate predictions, potential average revenue, and footfall figures.
Outputs the coordinates of the ideal location for setting up a new outlet.
Benefits:

Informed Decision Making: Location Matcher assists QSR chains in making informed decisions by evaluating potential locations based on real-time data and predictive analysis.
Risk Mitigation: By minimizing risks associated with new outlet locations, businesses can optimize their expansion strategies and enhance profitability.
Streamlined Expansion: Enables QSR chains to efficiently expand into new territories, tapping into markets with high success potential.
Why Location Matcher:
Traditional methods for selecting business locations are time-consuming and often lack precision. Location Matcher revolutionizes this process by integrating advanced data scraping techniques, machine learning algorithms, and real-time data analysis. By automating the decision-making process, QSR chains can focus on what they do best â€“ delivering exceptional service and products to their customers.

By leveraging Location Matcher, abCoffee and other QSR chains can navigate the complexities of expansion, ensuring sustainable growth and customer satisfaction.
